Hi there! My name is Karthik (he/him), and I'm orignially from the San Francisco Bay Area, but now studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I really enjoy working with data, so I have involved myself in many data science pursuits. You can check out my past projects at [my personal website](heykarthik.com). Outside of data science, I am very passionate about educational equity, and improving access to all forms of education to kids across the globe.
