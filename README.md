Hi there! My name is Karthik (he/him), and I'm from the Bay Area, but now am at Georgia Tech, studying Computer Science. I really enjoy working with data, so I have involved myself in many data science pursuits. You can check out my past projects at [my personal website](heykarthik.com). Outside of data science, I am very passionate about educational equity, and improving access to all forms of education to kids across the globe.

In my free time, I enjoy travelling, watching Netflix, playing board games, and spending time with friends. I'm always looking to meet new people, so feel free to reach out! Otherwise, I hope you enjoy my profile!
